## Dataset Description
The dataset we chose to use was obtained from data.gov and the source was the Department of Health and Human Services. This data is derived from information obtained from resident death certificates from all fifty states. This data is ordered by each state every year from 1999 - 2017. The columns in this dataset include, Year, Name of Cause of Death, State, Number of Deaths, and the Age-Adjusted Death Rate. Each row in this data represents the number of deaths for each cause of death within each state. For example a row would be the number of deaths Alzheimer's Disease caused in Georgia in 2015.

## Two Questions
1) Which states have abnormally high death rates and based off those findings is there a common cause of death that drives it? With this, what is the cause of death in regions where there are lower death rates?
2) Compared to the death rate of the United States, which states deviate from the US trend and is there a common factor leading to the outlier? Is there a certain state that has different trends compared to all other states?
